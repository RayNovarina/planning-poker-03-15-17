***** I did it, but it does not change anything in production
**** DONE understand the asset pre-compilation, and how the refs are patched before deployment
**** DONE understand how env variables are deployed through docker to heroku
***** It seems heroku is not really deploying a container, but a slug built from the container ! https://github.com/heroku/heroku-container-tools/issues/142. That goes against the main point of docker !
